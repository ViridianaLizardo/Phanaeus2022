# Title of Dataset: Supplementary material of Distribution, Regionalization, and Diversity of the dung beetle
genus Phanaeus MacLeay (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) using Species Distribution Models
---

Brief summary of dataset contents, contextualized in experimental procedures and results.


## Description of the Data and file structure

S01_Predicted_and_recorded_distribution_maps_Phanaeus.pdf : Recorded distribution of Phanaeus species by country, state, and provinces (from GADM), and by Biome and ecorrgions. We also provide the recorded elevational range along with environmental ranges
(extent, size, mean annual temperature, maximum difference of temperature during the year and mean annual precipitation) obtained from Maxent species distribution models. Maps of the recorded and Predicted distribution are included, by species group and individual species.

phanaeus_regionalization.gpkg: Vectorized data of the resulting regionalization of the American continent based on the predicted distribution of Phanaeus species. 

phanaeus_SDM_vector.zip: Vectorized data of the predicted presence of each Phanaeus species modelled. 

occurrence_data.zip : Occurrence data used to model the predicted distribution of Phanaeus Species.
